        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p style = "text-align: justify"> I am a 4th year student at the University of Alberta pursuing my Bsc Honors degree in Computing Science. I am very passionate about technology and interested in solving complex problems through the use of computer systems and software. I have strong analytical and problem-solving skills, as well as an aptitude for math and logic.
            In addition to technical skills, I also have strong communication and teamwork skills, which I have learned and honed by working effectively with others on complex projects. Other than studying and working, I try to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field by attending industry events and conferences, and contributing to open-source projects.
